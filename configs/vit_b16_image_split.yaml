# Model Configuration - ViT-B/16
# Experiment: Freeze backbone to prevent overfitting on small dataset
model:
  type: "vit_b16"
  num_classes: 2
  pretrained: true        # Use ImageNet pretrained weights
  freeze_backbone: true   # ← CHANGED: Only train classification head (86M → 1.5K params)
  drop_rate: 0.5          # ← ADDED: High dropout on classification head
  drop_path_rate: 0.1     # Stochastic depth (not used when frozen)

# Training Configuration - Full 50 epochs
# Enhanced regularization to combat overfitting on small dataset (210 images)
training:
